# To generate new data rows for the Wine Quality Dataset that are plausible and maintain the statistical properties of the original data, we can employ data generation techniques such as using Gaussian mixture models, or simpler methodologies like sampling from the existing data distribution.

# An effective yet simple approach can be to model each numerical feature distribution with a Gaussian distribution, assuming that the features are roughly normally distributed. For the categorical features (like the 'type' field which can be white or red), we can use a categorical distribution. Then, we can sample from these distributions to create new data points.

# Here's a basic Python function that demonstrates how to generate new wine quality data rows using the `numpy` library. This function does not take into account the potential correlations between features, so if you need a more sophisticated model that does, you would need to employ multivariate distribution models or machine learning methods that capture feature dependencies.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# The Wine Quality Dataset columns
COLUMNS = ['type', 'fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 
           'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 
           'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 
           'alcohol', 'quality']

def generate_wine_quality_data(existing_data, num_rows=1):
    new_data = []
    for _ in range(num_rows):
        # Assume that 'type' is binary where 0 is white and 1 is red
        wine_type = np.random.choice(['white', 'red']) 
        
        # For simplicity, we are using a normal distribution for all numerical features
        # Here you would calculate the means and std devs from the real dataset columns
        means = existing_data.mean()
        stds = existing_data.std()
        
        numerical_data = np.random.normal(loc=means, scale=stds)
        
        # Ensure that certain values which should only be positive are not negative
        numerical_data = np.abs(numerical_data)
        
        # Here we could also round or clip values to make more sense for the real-world data
        # For example, quality is usually an integer between 0 and 10
        numerical_data[-1] = np.clip(round(numerical_data[-1]), 0, 10)
        
        row_data = [wine_type] + numerical_data.tolist()
        new_data.append(row_data)
        
    # Create a DataFrame for the new rows
    new_data_df = pd.DataFrame(new_data, columns=COLUMNS)
    return new_data_df

# Existing data (assuming you have loaded the Wine Quality Dataset into a DataFrame called `df`)
existing_data = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # select only the numerical columns for simplicity

# Generate 5 new data rows
new_wine_data = generate_wine_quality_data(existing_data, num_rows=5)
print(new_wine_data)


# Keep in mind that this function does not handle many realistic constraints of the dataset. For example, certain attributes like pH values should fall within a certain range, alcohol content is typically between certain percentages, etc. In practice, you might want to employ more sophisticated generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or use conditional generation that respects such constraints.

# Moreover, the actual implementation of `existing_data.mean()` and `existing_data.std()` should be based on a DataFrame that contains the existing data, which we have not done here but would need to be done in a real scenario where you have the dataset loaded into a DataFrame named `df`.
